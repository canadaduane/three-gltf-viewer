# glTF Viewer

Preview glTF 2.0 models in WebGL using three.js and a drag-and-drop interface.

Modified from Don Mccurdy's original to understand vertex groups as implemented [here](https://github.com/scurest/glTF-Blender-IO/tree/custom-data) (see also [this issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1232)), and allow you to change the colors of all vertices in a group.
